- **File**: `backend/src/middleware/auth.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
  - Long-lived refresh tokens (7 days) stored in Redis
  - Token blacklisting capability
  - Session validation with IP address checking
  - Multi-device session management
  - Automatic token cleanup

### 5. Enhanced Authentication Security ✅
- **File**: `backend/src/middleware/auth.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Token blacklist checking
  - Session validation middleware
  - IP address consistency validation
  - User agent tracking
  - Secure session creation and destruction

### 6. Security Headers Implementation ✅
- **File**: `backend/src/middleware/security.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive Helmet.js configuration
  - Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
  - HSTS with preload

### 7. Server Security Configuration ✅
- **File**: `backend/src/server.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Trust proxy configuration for accurate IP addresses
  - CORS with strict origin validation
  - Security middleware stack integration
  - Rate limiting applied to specific route groups
  - Input validation on all endpoints

## Security Middleware Stack

The security middleware is applied in the following order:
1. **HTTPS Enforcement** - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
2. **Security Headers** - Apply comprehensive security headers
3. **CORS Validation** - Validate request origins
4. **DDoS Protection** - Check for suspicious activity
5. **Rate Limiting** - Apply appropriate rate limits
6. **Input Sanitization** - Clean and validate all inputs
7. **Authentication** - Verify JWT tokens and sessions
8. **Authorization** - Check user permissions
