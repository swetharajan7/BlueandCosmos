                  question: "What happens when you push a ball?",
                  answer: "The ball moves away from you",
                  explanation: "A push is a force that moves objects away from you. When you apply force to a ball by pushing it, the ball moves in the direction of the push.",

                  answer: "Speed is how fast something moves; velocity includes direction",
                  explanation: "Speed only tells us how fast an object is moving (like 30 mph). Velocity tells us both how fast AND in what direction (like 30 mph north). Velocity is speed with direction.",

                  question: "What is Newton's First Law of Motion?",
                  answer: "An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by a force",
                  explanation: "This is also called the Law of Inertia. It means objects don't change their motion unless something pushes or pulls them. A ball won't start rolling by itself, and a rolling ball won't stop unless friction or another force stops it.",
                  hint: "Think about what happens to objects when no force acts on them",
