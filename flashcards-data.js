                  answer: "The ball moves away from you",
                  explanation: "A push is a force that moves objects away from you. When you apply force to a ball by pushing it, the ball moves in the direction of the push.",

                  answer: "Gravity",
                  explanation: "Gravity is a force that pulls everything toward the Earth. That's why when you drop something, it falls down to the ground instead of floating up to the ceiling.",

                  answer: "Speed is how fast something moves; velocity includes direction",
                  explanation: "Speed only tells us how fast an object is moving (like 30 mph). Velocity tells us both how fast AND in what direction (like 30 mph north). Velocity is speed with direction.",

                  question: "What is Newton's First Law of Motion?",
                  answer: "An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by a force",
                  explanation: "This is also called the Law of Inertia. It means objects don't change their motion unless something pushes or pulls them. A ball won't start rolling by itself, and a rolling ball won't stop unless friction or another force stops it.",
                  hint: "Think about what happens to objects when no force acts on them",

                  answer: "Kinetic energy and potential energy",
                  explanation: "Kinetic energy is the energy of motion - anything that's moving has kinetic energy. Potential energy is stored energy - like a ball held up high or a stretched rubber band.",

                  answer: "The rate of change of velocity with respect to time",
                  explanation: "Acceleration measures how quickly velocity changes. It can be speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction. It's measured in m/s¬≤ (meters per second squared).",

                  explanation: "First convert 60 mph to m/s: 60 mph = 26.8 m/s. Then use a = Œîv/Œît = (26.8 - 0)/8 = 3.36 m/s¬≤",

                  question: "State Newton's Second Law of Motion",
                  answer: "F = ma (Force equals mass times acceleration)",
                  explanation: "The net force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. This means heavier objects need more force to accelerate them the same amount.",

                  question: "What is the difference between heat and temperature?",
                  answer: "Temperature measures average kinetic energy of particles; heat is energy transfer",
                  explanation: "Temperature is a measure of how fast particles are moving on average. Heat is the energy that flows from hot objects to cold objects. You can have a small amount of very hot material (high temperature, low heat) or a large amount of warm material (moderate temperature, high heat).",

                  answer: "v = fŒª (wave speed = frequency √ó wavelength)",
                  explanation: "Wave speed equals frequency times wavelength. If frequency increases, wavelength decreases (and vice versa) to maintain constant speed in the same medium.",
