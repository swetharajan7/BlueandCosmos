   - Close database connections
   - Clear timers and intervals

3. **Flaky Tests**
   - Add proper wait conditions
   - Use deterministic test data
   - Avoid time-dependent assertions

4. **Performance Test Variability**
   - Run multiple iterations
   - Use statistical analysis
   - Account for system load variations

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
VERBOSE_TESTS=true npm test

# Debug specific test file
npm test -- --testNamePattern="specific test name"

# Run tests with debugger
node --inspect-brk node_modules/.bin/jest --runInBand
```

## Best Practices

### Test Organization
- Group related tests in describe blocks
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Keep tests independent and isolated

### Mock Strategy
- Mock external dependencies
- Use real implementations for internal services
- Provide realistic mock data
- Verify mock interactions

### Performance Testing
- Establish baseline metrics
- Test under realistic load conditions
- Monitor resource usage
- Use statistical analysis for results

### Security Testing
- Test both positive and negative scenarios
- Validate all input vectors
- Check authorization at every level
- Verify audit logging completeness

## Maintenance
